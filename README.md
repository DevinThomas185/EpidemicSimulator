# Epidemic Simulator
This project is an Epidemic Simulator with many variables that can be adjusted:
- Infectivity (distance to infect)
- Duration of immunity (length of immunity)
- Duration of symptions (how long the infection lasts for)
- Mask wearing probability (probability that a random person wears a mask)
- Mask wearer infectivity (probability of spread wearing a mask)
- Non-mask wearer infectivity (probability of spread not wearing a mask)
- Mask wearer vulnerability (probability of catching wearing a mask)
- Non-mask wearer vulnerability (probability of catching not wearing a mask)
- Random infection test (probability of being selected for a random test for the infection)
- False positive rate (probability of a false positive test)
- False negative rate (probability of a false negative test)
- Death rate at each age bracket (probability of death at different decades of age)
- Duration of simulation (how long the simulation ran for)

Parameters can be adjusted in order to analyse the effects of the change on a pandemic. This can aid in learning about the best strategies in order to control the epidemic better.

After simulating the epidemic, graphs and charts are produced to analyse the spread of the infection as well as the
